# Praxis

**Semantic Command & Control Framework for AI Agents**

As AI computer-use/coding agents become more prevalent - with tools that can read files, execute commands, and interact directly with systems - understanding their security properties becomes critical.

Praxis is an open-source research and experimentation platform for discovering, controlling, and orchestrating computer-use AI agents across endpoints.

We're hoping to enrich our understanding of what's possible when you have legitimate access to the systems these agents run on, and what that means for endpoint security.

Built by [Origin](https://originhq.com) for security research and red team operations.

## Features

**Discover** and fingerprint agents on endpoints. **Recon** their tools, configs, and session histories. **Intercept** agent-to-LLM traffic with a built-in MITM proxy. Open **interactive sessions** to dialog with agents, or define **semantic operations** that chain natural language tasks with automatic triggers. Includes a **toolkit** of built-in offensive operations, **terminal access** to remote nodes, and an experimental **orchestrator** for coordinating across agents.

## Quick Start

### One-Liner (Docker)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://praxis.originhq.com/docker.sh | bash
```

This clones the latest release, builds with Docker Compose, and starts the service, web UI, and RabbitMQ. Open **http://localhost:8080** in your browser.

The CLI binary is built into the Docker image. Extract it with:

```bash
docker cp praxis-praxis-1:/app/praxis_cli ./praxis_cli
```

### Native Install

```bash
# Linux/macOS
curl -fsSL https://praxis.originhq.com/install.sh | bash
```

This installs Rust if needed, builds from source, and sets up binaries in `~/.praxis/bin/` including `praxis_cli`.

### Windows

```powershell
irm https://praxis.originhq.com/install.ps1 | iex
```

> For detailed installation instructions (cross-compilation, deployment patterns), see the [full documentation](https://originsec.github.io/praxis/).

### Deploy Nodes

Once the service is running, deploy nodes to target systems:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Service** in the web UI
2. Download the appropriate node binary (Linux or Windows)
3. Run the node on the target system:

```bash
# Linux (localhost RabbitMQ URL for testing)
./praxis_node

# Or with custom RabbitMQ URL
PRAXIS_RABBITMQ_URL=amqp://user:pass@your-server:5672 ./praxis_node
```

```powershell
# Windows (localhost RabbitMQ URL for testing)
.\praxis_node.exe

# Or with custom RabbitMQ URL
$env:PRAXIS_RABBITMQ_URL="amqp://user:pass@your-server:5672"; .\praxis_node.exe
```

Node binaries are also available from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/originsec/praxis/releases).

## Initial Configuration

After starting Praxis, configure at least one LLM provider in **Settings** → **LLM Providers**:

1. Add a model definition (provider + model + API key)
2. Assign it to the features you want to use:
   - **Semantic Operations** - for executing operations
   - **Semantic Parser** - for tool discovery during recon
   - **Traffic Parser** - for summarizing intercepted traffic
   - **Orchestrator** - for the high-level task coordination assistant

We recommend low-latency providers (for example **Groq** or **Cerebras**) for parser-heavy workflows.

## CLI

The Praxis CLI (`praxis_cli`) provides a full-featured interactive terminal UI and a non-interactive command surface.

Running `praxis_cli` with no arguments launches the terminal UI with four main windows:
- **Orchestrator** (`Ctrl+O`) — LLM-powered conversation interface with tool execution and plan tracking
- **Nodes** (`Ctrl+L`) — node/agent management, session chat, and PTY terminal access
- **Operations** (`Ctrl+P`) — operation library, chain definitions, and live execution tracking
- **Settings** (`Ctrl+S`) — LLM provider management and service configuration

Non-interactive commands are also available for scripting:
```bash
praxis_cli -C "node list"
praxis_cli session create --node abc123 --yolo
```

See [CLI documentation](https://originsec.github.io/praxis/usage/cli.html) for the full reference.

## Architecture At A Glance

Praxis has three core components:

- **Node**: runs on target systems, discovers agents, handles sessions/recon/interception
- **Service**: central backend + database + operation/chain orchestration
- **Web**: React frontend and WebSocket bridge

See [Architecture Overview](https://originsec.github.io/praxis/architecture/overview.html) for detailed internals.

## Early Release Notice

This is an early release to showcase initial capabilities. It is **not yet ready** for full-scale red teaming or production use - although you can certainly experiment to your hearts content!

The platform is under active development and:

- Some features are incomplete or experimental
- The codebase is evolving rapidly
- **This is not designed to be stealthy** it installs root certificates, modifies system settings, and is generally quite noisy

We're releasing early to get feedback and contributions from the community.
